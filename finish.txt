You fill the weather machine with fifty stars. It comes to life!

Snow begins to fall.

Congratulations! You've finished every puzzle! I hope you had as much fun solving them as I had making them for you. I'd love to hear about your adventure; you can get in touch with me via contact info on my website or through Twitter.

Advent is over, but Advent of Code isn't going anywhere. You can support it by donating or even just sharing it with others.

If you'd like to hear about projects I release in the future, you can follow me on Twitter.

I've also highlighted the easter eggs in each puzzle, just in case you missed any. Hover your mouse over them, and the easter egg will appear.
