Advent of Code - NodeJS
=======================

This December, I participated in Advent of Code, which is a collection of 25 programming challenges, one for each day leading up to Christmas. More information [here](http://adventofcode.com/about).

I thought that over the course of these 25 challenges, I could brush up on a language that I haven't worked with in a while â€“ Javascript (more specifically NodeJS).

Notes
-----

Each solution reads input from stdin and outputs the answer for the day and associated part.

>   `node 1.js < input.txt` will give the solution for part 1  
    `node 2.js < input.txt` will give the solution for part 2

Some solutions may also allow command line arguments for special problem requests (i.e. Cookie calories on [day 15](/day15/problem.txt#L32))

**MERRY CHRISTMAS!**
