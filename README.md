Advent of Code
--------------

This December, I participated in Advent of Code, which is a collection of 25 programming challenges, one for each day leading up to Christmas. More information [here](http://adventofcode.com/about).

I decided to solve the challenges in a language that I was not very familiar with â€“ Node, as a fun way to learn it.
